			During the course of week-0 at KIT I've learn alot. First of them all was understanding the foundation and invention of the web. I learn thatthe web was invented by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 and the main purpose was to solve to issue of sharing information. I've learn about the structure of HTML document.HTML documents include a document type declaration and the 'html' root element. Nested in the 'html' element are the document head and document body. I also learn about Sematic element which means relating to meaning. Writing semantic HTML means using HTML elements to structure your content based on each element's meaning, not its appearance. <br> <br>
		
			Also, I learned about html attribute  are what make HTML so powerful because they define the behavior, linkages, and functionality of elements. Additionally, I learned how to link web pages and other html files. I also learned about how to list items. In html there are ordered lists (ol), unordered lists (ul), and description lists (dl). I also learn about tables and HTML tables are used for displaying tabular data with rows and columns. A i learn about forms and that the html form elements identifies a document landmark containing interactive controls for submitting information. I also learn the different between elements and attributes. <br> <br>

			Also in week-0, I was introduce to Javascritp. I learn about the history, its inventor and the purpose. I was inturdose to variable, and i learn how to declear a variable and assign a value to it. I learn the different let, var and const of which i did some summary and assignments.

			During week-1, i started adding some futures to my web pages when i started learning about CSS. I learn about css flex box, and its is a layout model designed for one-dimensional content. I learn about creating a flex container, controlling the direction of flrx items, wrapping flex items, controllng spaces inside flex items, reordering flex items, and flexbox alignment.  <br> <br>

			I also learn about css layout and learn that before the coming of css document were laid out with tables.
			I learning about block element and inline element, understanding the different between the marging box, border box, padding box and the content. I learn about css flexbox and grid where flexbox is a layout model designed for one-dimensional content and grid  is similar in a lot of ways to flexbox, but it is designed to control multi-axis layouts instead of single-axis layouts (vertical or horizontal space).
		
			I continue my study of Javascript and was intuouce to function, function decleration and dom manipulation and DOM is an acronym that stands for Document Object Model. Itâ€™s how a web browser represents a web page internally.The DOM is represented as a type of data structure called a tree. And functions are block of code that add functionality to our work.
